                      <img src="img/about_me.jpg" alt="Erin Brunet" class="left"/> <p> I  love to develop and reinforce the many skill-sets that I have learned throughout my career.  My keen eye and strong attention to detail help assure successful task completion whether it is day-to-day operations or large-scale project management.

                        After years of working with IT professionals as a project manager in the hospitality industry, I realized I had to become self-sufficient if I wanted to get my work done and keep my job.  I didn’t ave the same conventional business hours as the IT professionals and if I wanted to get home in time to kiss my kids goodnight, I had to teach myself several tricks to handle the glitches or crises that can occur in massive operations after 5 p.m., sometimes with hundreds of people depending on you.  Other times major and minor details of a project would be better suited for everyone if I tweaked the issues myself.  I knew the organization I was working for better than the outside contractors and could provide quicker results, even if it meant I had to teach myself a new software or an IT skill.  Hundred of hours, failed attempts, and a few major successes later, I still couldn’t get enough of this techy stuff! When the opportunity presented itself, I decided I needed to take my hobby to the next level and complete the Break Into Tech Blueprint through Skillcrush.
